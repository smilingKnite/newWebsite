<b>Hello Friend</b>, <br><br> My name is Tyler Mondragon and I made this website to show off to the right person. This site is not fully functional yet so if you would like to see more please visit my <em>About This Dude page</em>. I am showcasing this because though I spend most of my time around computers just coding I still enjoy animation and drawing above anything else. A big <b>In Your Face</b> to the teachers who made me stop doodling! If you need a designer, hit me up!
